        <h2>Usability Assessment & Evaluation</h2>
        <p><a href="ZoomIN">Michigan ZoomIN</a> aims to become a more widespread tool for wildlife exploration and cataloging, especially focusing on student and educator use. Its services are currently used to create projects that track and classify animals in the wild in Michigan. Since ZoomIN is a relatively niche tool, this project aims to explore how ZoomIN can attract and retain new users. By conducting in-depth interviews, survey, usability testing, and heuristics evaluation with educators and students, ZoomIN can better identify how to cater to these groups in their site designs and content management.</p>

        <h2>About Michigan ZoomIN</h2>
        <p>Michigan ZoomIN is a crowdsourcing science tool that provides a platform for the public to engage with image classifications of wildlife animals. Classifications and data points provided by users are used to understand the vulnerabilities of carnivores communities in Michigan and gain insights on the conservation methods of carnivores to respond to shifting environmental conditions such as climate change. Moreover, Michigan ZoomIN is aiming to broaden participation and improve environmental literacy by serving as an education and information tool for K-12, science educators, universities, and the Zooniverse community.</p>

        <h2>Step 1: Interaction Map</h2><br>
        <h3>Why did we make an interaction map?</h3>
        <p>We believe an interaction map is a very vital tool for us to understand a system thoroughly. By grouping different features and their purposes, we can get a better idea about the information hierarchy of ZoomIN.<br>Our findings:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>There are ZoomIN 5 major features, which include "classify", "about", "field guide", "collect", and "talk".</li>
            <li>The most important feature is classification. The main purpose of the field guide and about page is to inform users about wildlife knowledge. The talk and collect features are connecting users and further build up a sense of online community.</li>
        </ol>

<div class="bg_white">
        <h2>Step 2: Interviews</h2><br>
        <h3>Why should we conduct interviews?</h3>
        <p>UX researchers are not the users. We need to know users' mental models, current usage/habits, needs, motivations, and the context to better understand both potential and current user segments.<br>First, we conducted an interview with our stakeholders. After the interview, our team was able to understand that:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>ZoomIN has some expert users that contribute extensively to the site, but it can be more difficult for new users to be on-boarded.</li>
            <li>Educators integrate the tool into their curriculum, but not as much or as commonly as ZoomIN would like.</li>
            <li>ZoomIN has such a wide target user base that ZoomIN did not want to contain research to just one group, but rather conduct research in a more exploratory fashion.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Interview objectives</h3>
        <p>From this information, our team conducted interviews in pairs with 5 target users that vary in their characteristics: high school student, child, undergraduate students, and educator. Our interview objectives included:</p>
        <div class="project_photowrap">
            <div><img src="./imgs/zoom_3.png" alt="Interviews"></div>
        </div>
        <h3>Findings</h3>
        <div class="project_photowrap">
            <div><img src="./imgs/zoom_4.png" alt="Findings"></div>
        </div>
        <h3>Recommendations</h3>
        <p>Our team identified that while ZoomIN seemed like an engaging and helpful tool, it was unclear to novice users what the purpose of the site was and what it would really accomplish from a learning standpoint. Several interviewees also pointed out that a summary of data collection methods and key statistical data would help them better understand the project and motivate them to participate.</p>
        <div class="project_photowrap">
            <div><img src="./imgs/zoom_5.png" alt="Recommendations"></div>
        </div>
        <p>Based on our interview findings, we also made personas to make sure the team keeps our user segments in mind and as a guide for our future research.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Comparative Analysis</h2><br>
    <h3>Why comparative analysis?</h3>
    <p>A comparative analysis can help us understand where the product or service stands in the market; know the strengths and weaknesses of your competition; have reliable evidence when making product changes, and so on.

    We identified one indirect competitor: Crowdcrafting, one parallel competitor: Google Vision API, two partial competitors: Sporcle and Audubon, and two analogous competitors: Tinder and Bumble. We analyzed how each tool engages their users in classifying images or learning about wildlife.</p><br>
    <h3>Research goals</h3>
    <p>ZoomIN reports having a lot of “one-time” users, so we wanted to know how to encourage users to return and get engaged. Not only this, we wanted to explore how the flow and on-boarding of other sites work, in order to provide recommendations to ZoomIN’s onboarding process. After all, during the last interview phase, we found that many students and educators did not get a holistic sense of ZoomIN’s functionality and purpose easily.</p><br>
    <h3>Research questions</h3>
    <div class="project_photowrap">
            <div><img src="./imgs/zoom_9.png" alt="Research questions"></div>
        </div>
    <h3>Criteria of selection</h3>
    <p>We selected our competitors based on trying to get a diverse set in differing categories (indirect, direct, partial, parallel, analogous). Some of the specific criteria we looked for in the products were as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Demonstrated high user retention</li>
        <li>Served a clear, specific function</li>
        <li>Had an onboarding process that was intuitive and provided ample context</li>
        <li>Had multiple types of users, to match ZoomIN’s two-sided user base of learners and educators</li>
        <li>Facilitated social connections</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="project_photowrap">
            <div><img src="./imgs/zoom_10.png" alt="Criteria of selection"></div>
    </div>
    <h3>Recommendations</h3>
    <p>We discovered some successful features that ZoomIN can refer to and possibly incorporate into the platform design changes:</p>
    <div class="project_photowrap">
            <div><img src="./imgs/zoom_11.png" alt="Recommendations"></div>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="bg_white">
    <h2>Step 4: Survey</h2><br>
    <h3>Why survey?</h3>
    <p>Conducting surveys can mitigating risk of designing the wrong, or a poor, solution for users, and it can provide stakeholders and researchers with confidence that a design will be effective. To have a broader understanding of our target user segments, we need to know their behaviors and motivation through a representative number of samples.</p><br>
    <h3>Research goals</h3>
    <p>This survey project aims to understand college students and educators interests in biological knowledge learning and educational tools. Our survey took the approach of dividing into 2 paths: student and educator, in order to categorize the responses to these questions. One of our goals was also to see if the answers align between students and educators. For instance, if students highly value informal class discussion, is this something that educators concurrently build into their lesson plans commonly?</p><br>
    <h3>Research questions</h3>
    <div class="project_photowrap">
            <div><img src="./imgs/zoom_12.png" alt="Research questions"></div>

    <h3>Findings</h3>
    <div class="project_photowrap">
            <div><img src="./imgs/zoom_13.png" alt="Finding 1"></div>
    </div>
    <p>Educators revealed that their students engage with materials the best by informal class discussion and independent study.</p>
    <div class="project_photowrap">
            <div><img src="./imgs/zoom_14.png" alt="Finding 2"></div>
    </div>
    <p>Biology major students thought the topic and the contribution to the greater good motivate them to participate in crowdsourcing.</p>
    <div class="project_photowrap">
            <div><img src="./imgs/zoom_15.png" alt="Finding 3"></div>
    </div>
    <p>But for non-biology major students, the topic and being rewarded motivate their participation.</p><br>

    <div class="project_photowrap">
            <div><img src="./imgs/zoom_16.png" alt="Recommendations"></div>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="bg_ivory">
    <h2>Step 5: Heuristic Evaluation</h2><br>
    <h3>Why heuristic evaluation?</h3>
    <p>User feedbacks are pricey and interpreting them is also time-consuming. Heuristic evaluation helps researchers narrow down the potential usability issues and further save resources for future usability testing.</p><br>
    <h3>Research goals</h3>
    <p>Our goal during this heuristic evaluation was to understand the specific issues a user have in a typical flow of using the system. ZoomIN reports having a lot of “one-time” users, so we wanted to know how to encourage users to return and get engaged by making their process as easy as possible.</p><br>
    <h3>Research questions</h3>
    <div class="project_photowrap">
            <div><img src="./imgs/zoom_17.png" alt="Research questions"></div>
    </div>
    <h3>Process of evaluation</h3>
    <p>First, all 5 team members did individual passes of the tool and analyzed each section. We documented the violations of these heuristics and gave them scores of severity according to the Nielsen scale. The severity of a usability problem was addressed by looking at the following factors:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Frequency: How often does this impact a user’s workflow?</li>
        <li>Impact: If a user encounters this, does it have a domino effect on the rest of their use?</li>
        <li>Persistence: Is the incident isolated, or does it continue to occur in multiple areas of the platform?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each person also wrote about their issues, and scored the issue as a major or minor usability issue on the scale from 0-4, with 4 being a usability catastrophe.</p><br>
    <h3>Findings</h3>
    <p>After synthesizing, we were able to find out some common usability issues shared in most of individual reports:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The classification progress is invisible</li>
        <li>The warning sign, “you should log in”, isn’t obvious</li>
        <li>The classification category is detached from the real-world implication</li>
        <li>No way to go back to identification</li>
        <li>Using animal names takes recall instead of recognition</li>
        <li>The tutorial isn’t searchable and hard to discover</li>
        <li>“Nothing here” is inconspicuous leads the user to select randomly</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="project_photowrap">
            <div><img src="./imgs/zoom_18.png" alt="Findings"></div>
    </div>
    <h3>Recommendations</h3>
    <div class="project_photowrap">
            <div><img src="./imgs/zoom_19.png" alt="Recommendations"></div>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="bg_white">
    <h2>Step 6: Usability Testing</h2><br>
    <h3>Why usability testing?</h3>
    <p>Usability testing lets the design and development teams identify problems before they are coded. The earlier issues are identified and fixed, the less expensive the fixes will be in terms of both staff time and possible impact on the schedule. Although Michigan ZoomIN is a final coded product, we tried to give out the most feasible solution as possible.</p><br>
    <h3>Research goals</h3>
    <p>ZoomIN reports having a lot of novice users, so we wanted to know how to encourage users to return and get engaged by making their process as easy as possible. Specifically, because the classification process is at the core of the platform, we wanted to understand what may hinder a user’s classification process.</p><br>
    <h3>Research questions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>What issues may be causing the user to not gain adequate context of the purpose of the tool?</li>
        <li>What usability issues may be hindering the user’s confidence when making a classification?</li>
        <li>Where does the user get frustrated in the system?</li>
        <li>How can we speed up the workflow of the user when making a classification?</li>
    </ol><br>
    <h3>Methods</h3>
    <p>We conducted 5 usability tests with 5 participants that are new to Michigan ZoomIN (novice users). Each test included a pre-test questionnaire, 4 classification tasks, a Forum task, and finding information in the About section and field guide.</p>
    <h3>Tasks</h3>
    <p>The classification is the core of the platform, so this is why we had the user do four different classifications with different contexts and different follow up questions.</p>
    <div class="stats">
            <p class="number">5<br>users</p>
            <p class="number">10<br>tasks</p>
            <p class="number">5<br>key findings</p>
