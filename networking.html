        <h2>Making a seeker-friendly job board</h2>
        <p>There are numerous online job boards out there aiming to provide easy access to opportunities and dream jobs.  Networking opportunities, company reviews, and job postings are just a few of the basic features widely available today. With so many advanced tools to help us land our dream jobs, what possible downsides and obstacles do job seekers face?</p>

        <p>Nowadays, job seekers find themselves spending more and more time reading job postings and creating redundant accounts and profiles on different job boards. It’s time-consuming and overwhelming. Online job boards come across as repetitive and stale; no matter how smart or user-centered they claim to be.</p>
        <div class="project_photowrap">
            <div><img src="./imgs/networking_2.png" alt="online job boards"></div>

<div class="bg_ivory">
        <h2>Observation 1: Title-Driven</h2>
        <p>Today’s industries change more rapidly than students and educators are prepared for. Entirely new positions and job titles emerge not just from unprecedented skills and knowledge, but also dynamically as existing domains of knowledge are combined to meet industry needs. Add to this the non-standardized nature of titles and job descriptions between organizations and you have a shifting sea of targets.

Take data scientists  and UX designers for example. Many school career centers could not have predicted the existence and scale of these jobs 10 years ago. Most people would likely have filed all data-related jobs under data analyst or data processor and designer roles into ergonomics, graphics, or industrial design. But people in the relevant industries know better; they were doing these jobs long before the trendy phrases “data scientist” and “user experience“ arrived on the public scene.

Job titles will only become more fluid. Industries can easily combine new skills and do things differently at any moment! For those entering the workforce and people who hope to switch their career path, this fluctuation can be nearly impossible to keep up with without well-positioned contacts or mentors they can reach out to for help. A truly effective job board must reflect and adapt to this in order to better serve job-seekers.

Take a few seconds to observe the initial view that job boards present to new users, and you’ll find an experience that favors direct listings and geography. They always start by asking “what job title“ or “which company“. While this is extremely efficient for those who have a specific place or post in mind, <b>how do we better serve career exploration</b> and account for seekers with wide skillsets who might entertain multiple career options?</p>
        <div class="project_photowrap">
            <div><img src="./imgs/networking_3.png" alt="Observation 1: Title-Driven"></div>
        </div>

        <h2>Observation 2: Junk Descriptions</h2>
        <p>Job seekers spend a massive amount of time on job boards reading through the job descriptions, gauging whether or not they are qualified for a job. But the reality is that job titles and job descriptions simply don’t work! The information is often borrowed from other listings, inaccurate when compared to the work performed, and misleading in terms of needs and requirements. <br><br>In addition to misleading copy and paste postings, there’s often a disconnect between organizations and the broader market, and thus the job seeking community. Many companies have their own unique titles for positions. It’s also not uncommon for operations to get out-of-sync with human resources to the point where individuals at the same company hold the same title but are understood to perform very different tasks. The result is that sometimes similar jobs have different titles while other times the same titles don’t necessarily map to similar responsibilities.</p>
        <div class="project_photowrap">
            <div><img src="./imgs/networking_4.png" alt="Observation 2: Junk Descriptions"></div>
        </div>

        <p>With these observations in mind, I moved on to the data collection phase to truly understand the obstacles students encountered. The ultimate goal was to know: how can we make a service that is more job-explorer/job-seeker centered?</p>  

        <div class="project_photowrap">
            <div><img src="./imgs/networking_5.png" alt="Example 1"><p>Example 1: <b>Similar job responsibilities</b>, but came from <b>different job titles</b>.</p></div>
            <div><img src="./imgs/networking_6.png" alt="Example 2"><p>Example 2: <b>Different job responsibilities</b>, but came from the <b>same job titles</b>.</p></div>
        </div>  
</div>

<div class="bg_white">
        <h1>Research Process</h1>
        <h2>Data collection - seeing the big picture</h2>
        <p>First, I conducted a survey, both to serve as a screener for participant recruiting and to test a critical question to my hypotheses - <b>“Do students search for different career paths on job boards?”</b> 

The survey contained 13 questions, mainly to get an idea about what services students use, and to evaluate their eligibility for test participation. It was distributed on the Craigslist volunteer board and within job and internship groups on Facebook.</p>

<div class="project_photowrap">
            <div><img src="./imgs/networking_7.png" alt="Survey 1"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="stats">
            <p class="number">54<br>Survey responses</p>
            <p class="number">37<br>Females</p>
            <p class="number">17<br>Males</p>
        </div>
    <p>Below is the question I used to test my assumption: Do students search for different career paths?</p>
    <div class="project_photowrap">
            <div><img src="./imgs/networking_8.png" alt="Survey 2"></div>
        </div>

    <p>The question below served as a screener for follow-up. My goal was to find those who have done informational interviews so that they could share more details regarding their experience in gathering information.</p>
    <div class="project_photowrap">
            <div><img src="./imgs/networking_9.png" alt="Survey 3"></div>
        </div>

</div>
<div class="bg_ivory">
        <h2>Scoping the Project</h2>
        <p>After collecting survey data, there was an interesting, if somewhat unsurprising, trend in their responses. Students from a liberal arts background tend to have broader career interests or had yet to decide on a career path. This was evident by their use of varied and broad job titles.</p>
        <div class="project_photowrap">
            <div><img src="./imgs/networking_10.png" alt="Scoping the Project"></div>
        </div>
        <p>Hence I re-scope the project and focused on the following questions:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Identify the current obstacles liberal arts majors have</b> in using online job boards/networking services.</li>
            <li>How do they <b>deal with/bypass the problems they encountered during job searching.</b></li>
            <li>How do they <b>respond to the concept of job seeker-centered online job board.</b></li>
        </ul>
</div>
<div class="bg_white">
        <h2>Recruitment</h2>
        <p>I then invited the respondents who satisfied the 3 criteria below for a 30 to 60 minute interview with $10 as compensation.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>From liberal arts background </li>
            <li>Had entered at least 3 job titles in different fields on job boards</li>
            <li>Had conducted informational interviews</li>
        </ul>
</div>

<div class="bg_ivory">
    <h2>Discussion flow</h2>
    <p>While I was scheduling interviews with participants, I drafted the discussion guide and modified it according to suggestions provided by my mentors. The purpose was to understand more about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Their online job boards usage</li>
        <li>Their online networking experience</li>
        <li>How do they explore their career paths</li>
        <li>How do they feel about the job descriptions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Participant demographics</h2>
    <p>My participants age fell between 20-26 years old. Two of them were from communication studies; two were from design backgrounds; the other four were respectively from majors in Philosophy, Political Science, Sociology, Art & Humanities.</p>

    <h2>Reflection - What could I have done better?</h2>
    <p>Looking back, a few things I could have adjusted are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>I could have better spent my time narrowing down the topic early on as the project was initially very broad.</li>
        <li>After narrowing the focus of study, I could have opened the scope of the solution to a greater audience. The concept is beneficial not only LSA majors or career explorers, but anyone who’s looking to do a course correction or reality check within their career. Information and new skills don’t have to be hard to acquire and everyone stands to benefit from fine-tuning their career path.</li>
        <li>I could have interviewed people who lack educational resources or social capital like connections and networks. These individuals struggle to grow their network and climb up the social ladder, and thus have fewer opportunities. I’m curious, even with LinkedIn - how many people would reply to a message if the other person isn’t from the same college or within 3 degrees of network?</li>
        <li>I could have tried approaching the problem from the opposite direction - leveraging these insights to improve Human Resource productivity and workload via redesigned job board entry.</li>
        <li>I could have focused on designing a proper networking space where people can share the truth - after all, we surely don’t need another job board…</li>
