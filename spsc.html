                    <h2>St. Patrick Senior Center Website Revamp</h2>
                    <p>In 2018 spring break, St. Patrick Senior Center approached our school hoping to find one student helping with their website revamp. After a few rounds of applications, I was selected to help with the project. In 5 days of my spring break, I finished contextual inquiry, interviews, persona building, Google Trends analyzing, and sketching.</p>

                <h2>About St. Patrick Senior Center</h2>
                <p>In 1973, Sister Mary Watson opened the doors of St. Patrick Senior Center to seven elderly residents of Detroit’s Cass Corridor neighborhood and served a home-cooked, healthy meal. Today St. Patrick Senior Center has evolved into a comprehensive health and wellness program that provides valuable services including nutritious meals, an excellent health maintenance clinic, and transportation assistance to a diverse population of seniors age 55 and older. They offer educational classes in art, technology, exercise and dancing, healthy living and social activities.</p>

                <h2>Problem Overview</h2>
                <p>St. Patrick Senior Center's previous website was built over decades ago. The information architecture of the website was chaotic and staff members had a hard time maintaining the website. They also hope to gain marketing insights from Google Trends and have a new website that reflects the needs of their target audience.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="bg_ivory">
                <h2>Website - Before Revamp</h2>
                <p>The following screenshots show the previous homepage of the website. The most obvious problem was that there're <b>too many texts and important information was hidden deeply in the sidebar.</b> Most of the information that members need were presented by hyperlinked PDF files. The color combination didn't reflect the center's character, and the website was not responsive - <b>which means it's not friendly to older adults in lower SES who can only access to mobile phones instead of desktop computers/laptops.</b></p>

                <h1>Design Process</h1>
                <h2>Contextual inquiry & interview</h2>
                <p>
                    To further understand how staff members streamline their tasks and what information is the most important to their members, I conducted several interviews and observation at their workplaces. My interviewees included: the administrative assistant, a long-time donor, several members/volunteers, the benefits specialist, the activities director, an activities assistant, the community living support director, and a caregiver. The reason why I chose to interview those staff members was because they interacted with the members frequently and had the most knowledge about the center. The rest of the interviewees represented the major audience of the senior center. I drafted and customized every discussion guide before each interview. <b>To get the firsthand information, I also joined and observed their activities. Between breaks, I usually walked around and chatted with members, asking about their motivation to join the center and what kind of services they tried or activities they attained.</b> 
                    Before interviewing staff members, I usually spent quite awhile at their workspace observing and taking notes.

                <h2>Insights from the interview</h2>
                <h3>What do people ask when they call/visit the center?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>People ask about whether SPSC provides transportation for grocery shopping or other destination besides for medical appointment.</li>
                    <li>Asking about SPSC open hours, activities, health checkups, lunch time & fees.</li>
                    <li>Asking about housing and other minor home repairs.</li>
                    <li>People call the activity department very often just to ask about basic activities information.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Who does the center interact with?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most seniors make the call asking about information by themselves instead of by caregivers.</li>
                    <li>Current age group remains skeptical about social media and online payment.</li>
                    <li>Most outreach are physically done by the advertise department.</li>
                    <li>Health issues members usually concern the most: diabetes.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>How do people know about the center?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Most seniors know about SPSC by word of mouth.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Which activities/services are they interested in?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Popular services from the center include: Medicaid, food stamps, energy assistance, and transportation.</li>
                    <li>Popular activities include: hustle, ballroom, stepping, and round dancing.</li>
                    <li>Some wishlist include: providing intellectual classes, teaching people how to deal with retirement, financial stability, and tips for helping with memory.</li>
                    <li>People think providing different activities, full meals, and training with coach are the most special part about SPSC.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>What's the status quo?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Too much text on the current website.</li>
                    <li>Phone calls took away a lot of staff members’ time, which also increase the workload.</li>
                    <li>The center also has several marketable features that didn't exist on the website.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="project_photowrap">
                    <div><a href="imgs/spsc_context1.png" data-lightbox="gallery" data-title="Staff members rely heavily on paper files" aria-label="Staff members rely heavily on paper files"><img src="./imgs/spsc_context1_thumb.png" alt="Staff members rely heavily on paper files"></a></div>

                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="bg_white">
                <h2>Learnings</h2>
                <p>From the findings it's noticeable that people ask about basic information of the services. Staff members were overwhelmed by phone calls asking about simple questions. Therefore the senior center can try to address the problem by making information more available on their website.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make location, hours, activity, and other basic information about the center more accessible and user-friendly.</li>
                    <li>Highlight the meal the center provides, activities videos, fitness tips (photos/videos), information about Medicaid, food stamps, energy assistance, and transportation service.</li>
                    <li>Use photos, modify text content on the current web.</li>
                    <li>Investigate what other works occupy staff members’ time the most.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="bg_ivory">
                <h2>Persona</h2>
                <p>To capture the essence of the center's website target audience, I made 3 personas based on my interview and contextual inquiry findings. One interesting thing worths noticing is that a user's roles may overlapped from time to time. In the senior center, a lot of older-middle aged caregivers were volunteers or donors, too.</p>

            <div class="bg_white">
                <h2>Interaction Map - Before Revamp</h2>
                <p>Before I started the revamp, I made an interaction map of the website. Making an interaction map helped me to document what elements already existed on the website; it also kept any other coworkers who may manage the website well informed.</p>
                <div class="project_photowrap">
                    <div><a href="imgs/spsc_IA.png" data-lightbox="gallery" data-title="Interaction map" aria-label="Interaction map"><img src="./imgs/spsc_IA_thumb.png" alt="Interaction map"></a></div>

                <h2>Deciding IA - Card Sorting</h2>
                <p>I held a card sorting workshop with senior center members. They were asked to group the cards first, and then gave each group of cards a name. I removed a few features that users were not sure about the categories or ones that they don't see the value and needs out of them. The resulting information arcitecture became much simpler than the old website.</p>
